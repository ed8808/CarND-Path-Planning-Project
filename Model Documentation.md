# Path Planning Project
## The path generation methodology
1. Each waypoint is supplied to the simulator for every 20ms, there are altogether 50 waypoints.
2. The last 2 points and 3 upcoming waypoints at Frenet distance 50m, 70m and 90m in front of the car are used to fit in to a curve generated by SPLINE.
3. But before feeding into the SPLINE, the original map coordinates must be transformed to car coordinates using the cars XY as reference by
- shifting 
- rotation 
4. Previous left over waypoints are directly fed into the first part of array.
5. The remaining new waypoints are generated as follows: 
i) distance to go for all remaining points, e.g. 30m in this code
ii) partition the above distance by 30 / 0.02 * ref_speed 
6. Transform from car to map coordinates by rotation followed by shifting

To avoid failing of acceleration to exceed 10ms-2:
i) use progressively increment and decrement +/- 0.226mph per change for speed changes.  
ii) reduce speed to 40mph when performing lane changing

## Obstacle Avoidance methodology
### Obstacle detection
1. Scan all vehicles.  Filter only the right 3 lanes and ignore left opposite 3 lanes.
2. Find out distances between the car and the next cars which are either in front and at the back.

### State Machine
1. Check safety distance in front and at back
2. if current distance > 2 * safety distance, keep lane
3. if current distance < 2 * safety distance and car in next lane is far away, reduce speed and prepare lane change
4. if current distance < safety distance but unable to change lane due to traffic, reduce speed until bare minimum
